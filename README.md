# wireframing.

### **What is Wireframing?**
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a visual blueprint or skeletal outline of a digital product, such as a website or application. It represents the basic structure and layout of a user interface (UI) — including key elements like menus, buttons, images, and content areas — without focusing on colors, styles, or detailed design.  

Wireframes are typically created during the early stages of the design process to visualize how users will interact with the system before any coding or high-fidelity design begins.

### **Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process**
- **Clarifies Structure and Functionality**  
  Wireframes help define the placement of elements and how different components of the interface connect, ensuring a logical and user-friendly flow.

- **Facilitates Collaboration and Communication**  
  Designers, developers, and stakeholders can use wireframes to discuss ideas, make revisions, and align expectations before development starts.

- **Identifies Usability Issues Early**  
  By visualizing user interactions at an early stage, teams can detect navigation or layout issues before investing time in detailed design or development.

- **Saves Time and Resources**  
  Making changes in a wireframe is faster and less costly than modifying designs or code later in the project.
